# What does it consist of?
In this project, we try to solve the historical problem of protein folding through the simulated cooling algorithm (optimization algorithm). For this we have had to use some auxiliary functions, and then implement the algorithm. Subsequently, once the optimal folding has been obtained, we will represent it in 2D with a color gradient which represents the energy differential of that amino acid.

# Developing
We have developed the project using jupyter notebook, in order to be able to document each problem resolution procedure step by step. In addition, we have chosen the python programming language, since we believe that it is the most optimal language for solving this type of problems.

# Developed by
This project has been developed by Álvaro Úbeda Ruiz and Estefanía Ganfornina Trigueros for the subject "Artificial Intelligence" in the third year of software engineering.
